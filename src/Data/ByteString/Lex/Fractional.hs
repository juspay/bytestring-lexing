-- For types with inherently limited precision (e.g., 'Float' and

-- 'decimalPrecision') this is far more efficient than 'readDecimal'.
-- However, passing in a precision limit which is greater than the
-- type's inherent limitation will degrate performance compared to
-- 'readDecimal'.
--
-- For types with unlimited precision (e.g., 'Rational') this may
-- still be far more efficient than 'readDecimal' (it is for
-- 'Rational', in fact). The reason being that it delays the scaling
-- the significand\/mantissa by the exponent, thus allowing you to
-- further adjust the exponent before computing the final value
-- (e.g., as in 'readExponentialLimited'). This avoids the need to
-- renormalize intermediate results, and allows faster computation
-- of the scaling factor by doing it all at once.
